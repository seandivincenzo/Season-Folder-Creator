# Season-Folder-Creator
A simple batch file to automate creating season folders for media managment.

I made this batch script to automate the process of creating folders for seasons in TV Shows.
I have mild OCD where I like having very certain things a very certain way. I have a media server in plex and sometimes when adding media to it it becomes a hassle to create season folders and rename everything, and while I found solutions for renaming such as FileBot I still had trouble with this very specific thing of creating season folders.
In turn I created this batch script which is super simple to use, just run the script, input the location where you need the season folders, and the number of folders and it will do the rest almost instantly, it even has a feature for adding Season 0 for specials!
